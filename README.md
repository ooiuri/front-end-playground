# front-end-playground
Hey, I'm developing some css solutions based upon frontendmentor.io challenges. You can see what I've done yet at those following links.

## [1 - Profile Card Component](https://ooiuri.github.io/front-end-playground/profile-card-component/index.html)
This challenge is to build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
I'm using some html + css flex based stuff

## [2 - FAQ Accordion](https://ooiuri.github.io/front-end-playground/faq-accordion-card/index.html)
Hey, I really enjoyed this challenge. I'm using Html + Css + Vanilla Js to built this little accordion. It's working better at firefox rn, but i liked.


If you have any doubt or sugestion feel free to contact me (:
